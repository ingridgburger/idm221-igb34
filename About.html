        <h1>Hi, my name is <strong>Ingrid Burger</strong>!</h1>

    <article>
        <p>I am a sophomore studying <strong>User Experience and Interaction Design</strong> with a minor in Graphic Design at Drexel University, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>As an aspiring UX/UI designer, I am working, in and out of the classroom, to hone in my skills. Through my time at Drexel University and personal projects, I have gained experience in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience Design</li>
            <li>Interaciton Design</li>
            <li>Graphic Design</li>
            <li>Human-Computer Interaction</li>
            <li>User Research Methodologies</li>
            <li>Design Thinking Processes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With a background of fine arts and an in depth understanding of art theories and concepts, I merge creative explorations with practical design. I feel passionately about creating user experiences that are both beautiful and functional. This intersection of aesthetics and purpose pushes me to constantly look for new ways to create and express myself and my ideas.</p>
        <p>My creative side takes many forms, from painting and drawing to sewing and jewelry making. I love exploring new artistic mediums, with mixed media art being my latest fixation. I'm also a self-taught nail artist and serve as co-founder and designer for Patchwork Literary Magazine, which we're getting ready for our late Autumn launch. The magazine aims to amplify diverse voices in our community through various forms of creative expression. When I'm not creating, I'm exploring - whether hiking local trails or working towards my goal of visiting every National Park (nine down so far!).</p>
