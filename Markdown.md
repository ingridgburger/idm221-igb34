# Hummus Grill Redesign
  ## Introduction
  The website being analyzed and redesigned is Hummus Grill, a Mediterranean restaurant in University City, Philadelphia. It is a casual spot that does over-the-counter dining in-store as well as takeout (pickup or delivery) and catering online.
  In the original design, the identified major weaknesses were the webpage being overwhelming, confusing to navigate, and lacking visual appeal. When the user first enters the site, they first see long text, an overwhelming menu bar, and text placed on top of busy images. The placement of colors does not have sufficient interest to the user’s eyes. Between heading, subheading, and body text, there is little variation in font. Major text should be more eye-catching, in terms of both font and color. On this site, the average user’s main purpose is to order food quickly, which is slowed down by distracting, lengthy texts as well as other unnecessary content. There are many buttons crowding the menu bar at the top, all written in the same font with little distinction, making them blend together. The labeling on many of these buttons, too, is misleading, causing navigation to be overly difficult.
  ## Goals
  For redesigning this site, the main goals are to modernize the design, make it more concise, and prioritize different information. Modernizing the design will tackle issues related to visual appeal and assist easier navigation. Modernizing the website is important due to the target consumer- people between ages 18 and 24 living in University City. For the target audience, it is important that the design values hipness and trendiness. The current state of the Hummus Grill Website Design is visually very out-of-date, thus not appealing to who it should. Making information more concise will also help with more efficient navigation and will overwhelm users less. With a more sensible organization structure, usability of the website will increase. 
  ## User Research
  To complete my redesign, I started with user research so my design would be optimized for its target audience. Here is a user persona for the website:
  ![User Persona](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FAqGk6yzDMvBWFIuJE0WGCzhw8_L-_k/view?usp=drive_link)
  Located in University City, Hummus Grill primarily caters to college students aged 18-24. This means a few things for the redesign. As many students are on a tight budget, transparency with pricing is crucial. To accommodate the tech-savvy yet impatient demographic, the site needs to have streamlined navigation and clear content. Simplifying text, reducing clutter, and minimizing misleading buttons are all important for doing so. Young adults tend to like places that are more “aesthetic,” so a visually appealing interface is necessary. Users interested in Hummus Grill are likely fans of brands like Cava and Sweet Green, which have very sleek interfaces, so this website must meet that. People this age also highly value convenience, which can come from food delivery and takeout, so these should be well-advertised. Expanding social media presence and linking accounts to the homepage can further engage this demographic. The research lines up with many of my website redesign’s priorities: easy-to-find menus and prices, streamlined navigation, and engaging visuals.
  ## Design Choices
  Before creating the high-fidelity model of the website, I chose a color scheme, fonts, and basic design elements:
  ![Design Choices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jAhfuz7HRd4qCrn-2hoRAo5-P_8CfRcf/view?usp=drive_link)
  In choosing a color scheme, two main things went into consideration: the goal of modernization and the vibe of the restaurant. The redesign color scheme primarily features shades of yellow, off-white (close to white), and dark-gray (close to black). It keeps it simple with black and white, two colors used a lot in modern design, with the accent color of yellow. Modern design tends to feature a bold color that pops like this. It is also meant to reflect the vibes of the restaurant: a hip place for college students to grab cheap Mediterranean food. The colors black, white, and yellow are associated with the trendiness, with yellow being a young and energetic pop. I wanted to avoid a traditional Mediterranean food color scheme while still feeling like it fits. The color yellow can be associated with sunshine and brightness, hummus, and citrus fruits, all relating to Mediterranean food.
  The fonts used in this redesign- Roadrage, Koulen, and Lexend Deca- were carefully chosen to cultivate the right feeling. Roadrage is a rougher font, with some letters being crooked and there being a grain across it. This font was chosen to convey a youthful feeling that may be more relatable to the target consumer. Next, the typeface Koulen is still bold, but less than Roadrage. It is a cleaner font, so Koulen is used for more concise text. As the body text, Lexend Deca is a font that gives users a clear reading experience. It is designed for digital interfaces and is easier on the eyes than many other body paragraph typefaces. All of these fonts feel modern, matching the redesign goals.
  ## User Heuristics
  After completing the first rendition of my redesign, I asked three users of the key demographic to assess both the original and redesigned website models using heuristic evaluations. The results are below.
  ![User Heuristics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yCPx6eu5Ve3OudCqLkBCr86oqHqxpl05/view?usp=drive_link)
  At the time I ran these heuristics, there was generally more satisfaction with my redesign than the original website, though the redesign still had pieces to improve on. The redesign improved upon most of the issues identified with the original site, however, there remained areas for improvement. This included building the navigation system further, fixing forms and data entry, and developing search functionality.
  From here, I was able to perfect my redesign and produce final prototypes that had higher user satisfaction.
  ## Final Prototype
  The final redesign prototypes include a desktop, mobile, and tablet version:

  [MobileDemoLink](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZDQ9aeA7JxrZwcQqGzeyKOr-eL-IdGvP?usp=drive_link)
  [TabletDemoLink](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TkoAFTSIdd__Vvux5Vict9xnPvI8tR2E?usp=drive_link)
  Overall, my redesign was successful in meeting its intended goals: modernizing the design, making content more concise, and prioritizing different content. In terms of modernization, the redesign successfully fixed outdated fonts and graphics and better keeps up to trend for a young audience. It was far more concise with reorganized menu bars and buttons, a more streamlined ordering system, and more concise text and labeling. For information prioritization, the front page displays more important details and the links to ordering pages are easier to find. All in all, this redesign improved upon the original.

# Patchwork Cofounding and Web Design
  ## Introduction
The website being designed is for Patchwork, a magazine I am co-founding with Lola Hart at Drexel University. Patchwork is a student-run online literary magazine founded with a mission to provide a creative platform that weaves together the diverse voices and perspectives of the Drexel community. Inspired by the 90s zine movement, Patchwork aims to capture the energy, authenticity, and dynamism of that era's publishing culture.
  ## Starting the Magazine
  The concept for Patchwork emerged from a shared desire to celebrate the literary talents and artistic expressions of the Drexel community. We recognized a need for a medium that could unify and amplify both the unsung voices as well as the established writers and artists within our campus. We carefully considered how we could do this, and landed on a digital magazine. Along with being a co-founder, I have taken on a role on the team to develop the graphic design and digital interfaces necessary to make our vision a reality.
  Each issue of Patchwork is centered around a unifying theme, chosen to spark creativity and guide submissions. This thematic approach allows for a diverse range of perspectives and interpretations, resulting in a patchwork tapestry of ideas and narratives. We do not have many restrictions around what one may submit, the only rules being that written pieces must be under 2000 words and visual submissions (if time based) must be under 3 minutes. We hope for people to find a creative outlet in our magazine, from poetry to painting. For our first month's submissions, we decided to implement the theme of "patchwork" in honor of it being Patchwork's first edition.
  ## Goals
  The primary goal for the Patchwork website was to create a digital space that embodied the magazine's key characteristics: inclusivity, creativity, and community engagement.
  To provide a clear outline, the website's three main goals are as follows:
  1. Provide an accessible and user-friendly platform for submissions, reading the zine, and more about us.
  2. Capture the spirit of Patchwork through dynamic design elements and interactive features.
  3. Enable readers to connect with team members and engage in discussions around the published content.
  ## Design Choices
  *Color Scheme*: The color scheme was composed of shades of red accented by varied off-white tones. This combination of natural cream tones and bold reds created a striking visual identity with a sense of energy and vibrancy.
  *Graphics*: All graphics (aside from the logo, designed by our graphics team member) featured on the website were custom-made by me using Adobe Illustrator. By creating my own graphics, I was able to achieve a unified aesthetic across pages, with each visual element seamlessly blending together in style and color. The graphics were designed to capture the handcrafted, collage-like spirit of zines while still maintaining a modern, polished look.
  *Font Choices*:
  _Headers_: Treova, a fun and bold serif font, was used for all main headings. Its playful yet impactful style immediately grabbed attention and set the tone for the magazine's energetic nature.
  _Subheaders_: Minimalusta, a quirky sans-serif font, complemented the headers with its unique personality, adding more visual interest.
  _Body Text_:  Josefin Sans, a clean and legible sans-serif, was chosen for the body text, ensuring optimal readability while maintaining a cohesive typographic aesthetic.
  *Animations*: I incorporated animations throughout various aspects of the design. The custom graphics I created featured thoughtfully choreographed movements, breathing life into the visuals. Additionally, strategic use of animations on other elements, such as hover effects and scroll-triggered transitions, enhanced the overall user experience and fostered a greater sense of interactivity.
  Through carefully curated design choices, the Patchwork website strikes a balance between the handcrafted essence of zines and a polished, professional aesthetic. The combination of a bold color palette, custom graphics, playful typography, and thoughtful animations result offer an immersive digital space that embodies what our magazine is about.
  ## Working Design
  The working design of Patchwork successfully accomplished what it was set out to. Our first edition is yet to launch, but the website has been developed in pages but the digital reading interface, itself. Take a look through our pages below:

  The design of the Patchwork website captures our desired look of the 90s zine movement while providing a modern, user-friendly platform for showcasing literary and artistic works. The combination of bold typography, a vibrant color palette, and a collage-inspired layout created a visually striking and immersive experience for visitors.

# LaundroPet Product Design
  ## Introduction
  For this product, my team and I were tasked to identify a community, a challenge for them, and a product to solve it. The community we identified was college students who live on campus / in dorms. As my team and I all fit within this target community, we brainstormed issues that we face around the campus and dorms. The issue we identified was the frustration of the buildings’ laundry rooms caused by students not collecting their laundry on time. Our problem statement was that college students need to collect their laundry on time to avoid inconveniencing others.
  ## Goals
  To set forth our goals, we turned our problem statement into a research question: How might we alert and encourage students to collect their laundry?
  We identified a goal to solve the late laundry pick-up problem by providing a product that alerts and incentivizes college students.
  ## User Research
  To come up with the most efficient way to solve this issue, we began with user research to see what our target audience would respond to best. We interviewed students at Drexel who live in dorms and conducted internet research to find out more about our user.
  Some of our research findings were that students struggle to find time to do laundry between tight schedules, attending classes, homework, and/or part time jobs. 60% of students had rarely or never done their own laundry before coming to school. We also found that students love discounts, freebies, and incentives
  We created a profile for a sample user, Samantha Brookes:
  ![User Persona P1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18QfKCWLHkKkmTummvne9Dlbj7lR_YiQo/view?usp=drive_link)
  ![UserPersonaP2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WdtP69Wqt13HrxGtWd0Un_CCORc-NbDA/view?usp=drive_link)
  After creating a persona for Samantha, we then made an empathy map to put ourselves in the shoes of our user:
  ![EmpathyMap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17d0NFEpTlEFkflzbl_7c_46-I68xwCJD/view?usp=drive_link)
  By creating these, we were able to make our design more user-centered. We were able to understand the needs and wants of our audience.
  ## Ideation
  Our team worked collectively to come up with a few varied ideas for a product to tackle our problem. Our four best ideas are as follows:
  1. Laundry Bracelet
      - Use App to scan a QR code on machine to initiate bluetooth connection with the bracelet
      - Bracelet buzzes to alert laundry is complete
      - Similar to restaurant pagers
  2. Laundry Pet
      - Animal figure w/sensors that can be attached to your laundry machine and detect and alert your phone that the load is complete
      - Alert is only turned off when you go and successfully pick up your laundry
      - App with rewards for picking up your laundry on time
3. Laundry Adhesive Alert
    - Product that sticks to washer/dryer on the outside and uses touch ID to lock and unlock to the surface to enforce higher security
    - Can customize the screen of the product
    - Alerts phone through app that laundry is done
    - App has points for every time you do your laundry with the product, and can earn rewards with points
4. Laundry Ball
    - A ball with sensors that can be thrown into your laundry and detect and alert your phone that the load is complete
    - Gives out fragrance
    - Alert is only turned off when you go and successfully pick up your laundry
    - App with rewards for picking up your laundry on time
Each team member created sketches outlining their best idea:
![Concept Sketches](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h6X7I5RND84g0YIJmX-OK7fqsJ4luXVo/view?usp=drive_link)
The team then sat down to discuss which idea would be most effective. We opted for the laundry pet as it is memorable, fun, and went over well with potential users.
## Final Design
We then landed on a final design for the product:
![Final Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/134-wcoNkPTfcVNYlxTni4pSzTgkipCqK/view?usp=drive_link)
The Pet has three functions: attach, sense, collect. Use your fingerprint on the biometric lock to secure it to the machine then press the Power Button to turn it on. It senses the machine movements and sends status updates to the app throughout the load. When it is done, an alarm sounds on your phone that can only be turned off by a button on the physical Pet, ensuring you collect your laundry.
In the mobile app/widget, there are three parts: connect, alert, reward. Scan a QR code on the Pet, download the app, then add the widget to your home screen to view your Pet’s status. To alert you, a constant notification goes off when laundry is done, staying at the top of your screen, though not disabling any phone functions while there. You can adjust settings to snooze the alarm if desired. Picking up LaundroPet on time earns coins, used to customize your Pet.
Here is a basic prototype of the app's icon, widget, and homepage:
![DigitalPrototype](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-8x-5PKK0NeTY_7iCaUg6uMZ1-6ha3BC/view?usp=drive_link)
Though we did not create the final, polished design for the physical product, we constructed a paper prototype of a rough idea of what it would look like if sent to manufacturing:
![PhysicalPrototype](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JuWKkAaoxzCEKQe1Q_5Y9GCB4wH-ceji/view?usp=drive_link)
## Marketing
Our marketing strategies included social media integration, working in unison with colleges and universities, putting physical ads around campuses, offering new user discounts, family and friends referrals, and seasonal incentives:
